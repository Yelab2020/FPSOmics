abstract = {Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.},

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis is a widely used tool for analyzing gene expression data. However, current implementations are slow due to a large number of required samples for the analysis to have a good statistical power. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, that efficiently reuses one sample multiple times and thus speeds up the analysis. We show that it is possible to make hundreds of thousands permutations in a few minutes, which leads to very accurate p-values. This, in turn, allows applying standard FDR correction procedures, which are more accurate than the ones currently used. The method is implemented in a form of an R package and is freely available at https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea.},

abstract = {Citation details: Zhou,N. and Bao,J. FerrDb: a manually curated resource for regulators and markers of ferroptosis and ferroptosis-disease associations. Abstract Ferroptosis is a mode of regulated cell death that depends on iron. Cells die from the toxic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species. Ferroptosis is tightly linked to a variety of human diseases, such as cancers and degenerative diseases. The ferroptotic process is complicated and consists of a wide range of metabolites and biomolecules. Although great progress has been achieved, the mechanism of ferroptosis remains enigmatic. We have currently entered an era of extensive knowledge advancement, and thus, it is important to find ways to organize and utilize data efficiently. We have observed a high-quality knowledge base of ferroptosis research is lacking. In this study, we downloaded 784 ferroptosis articles from the PubMed database. Ferroptosis regulators and markers and associated diseases were extracted from these articles and annotated. In summary, 253 regulators (including 108 drivers, 69 suppressors, 35 inducers and 41 inhibitors), 111 markers and 95 ferroptosis-disease associations were found. We then developed FerrDb, the first manually curated database for regulators and markers of ferroptosis and ferroptosis-disease associations. The database has a user-friendly interface, and it will be updated every 6 months to offer long-term service. FerrDb is expected to help researchers acquire insights into ferroptosis.},
